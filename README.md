# Part 1: Web-scraping

This part scrapes through Booth's Random Walks website and downloads key data from each trip.
It then exports this data into a csv file, saved within the repository

# Part 2: Markov Model

This part takes as an input excerpts from my group's leaders, and attempts to match them to the
trip description that most closely aligns with their interests and backgrounds using a Markov model.

# Part 3: Word cloud

This part analyzes the data of current trip leaders to understand key attributes, backgrounds, and interests
that make for successful trip leaders.
